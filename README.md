This dataset is taken from the internet and does not indicate the authenticity of events that actually occurred. This dataset is used only for data processing purposes. This project is divided into two, namely simple data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. 

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. 

Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.
